    <h2>About Me </h2>
    <p> <img src="SemiPro.png" alt="Profile Picture" width="200" height="200" style="float: right;"> <br>
        I am an aspiring software developer currently enrolled in a Software Engineering Bootcamp at HyperionDev
        looking forward to a career in Tech.<br>
        I have extensive customer service experience from my time in the hospitality industry 
        which I believe has immensely improved my communication and soft skills.<br>
        I am passionate about Chemisty, Anatomy and Physiology and would like to combine them with my interest in App and Web development. <br>
        I'm also passionate about fitness, hiking and healthy living and binge watching fantasy and sci-fi movies and shows. <br>
